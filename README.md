# nyt_spelling_bee
a clone implementation of the popular word game _Spelling Bee_

# overview
Spelling Bee is web-based game developed by Frank Logo. Here, I have made implemented a version of the popular game from the ground up.

# basic rules:
The game plays as follows:
• Players are given seven letters – one yellow, six gray – displayed in hexagons (referred to as "hives")
• Players need to form as many words as possible given these seven letters. Words formed must:
– be a minimum of 4 characters long, and a maximum of 19 characters long
– contain only letters that appear in one of the hives. The same letter can be used multiple times.
– contain at least one occurrence of the letter in the yellow hive
– be an actual, English word
– not be a word already submitted by the player previously
• Players earn points on every unique word found, with longer words being worth more points (and a bonus for
using all seven letters in a single word). Different titles are given to the player as their score increases.
